      "title": "The Journey",
      "intro": "I grew up in a small village — the kind where evenings move slowly, where people know each other's footsteps, and where dreams feel like faraway cities with unreachable skylines.",
      "laptop": "My uncle worked in Dubai as a cleaner. One day, he sent me a laptop — old, heavy, slow, almost broken. But to me, it was everything. That single moment opened a crack in the universe.",
      "studio": "There was a small photo studio in the market. I would stand at the door and watch them edit pictures. Eventually, I asked, 'Can you teach me?' They didn't laugh. They didn't dismiss me. They simply said, 'Sit. Watch. Learn.'",
      "learning": "So I watched. Then practiced. Then experimented. Then failed. Then tried again. Learning became my escape — my quiet rebellion against limitations.",
      "smartphone": "And then, the laptop died. We couldn't afford a replacement. So I switched to my smartphone — editing on a tiny screen, using slow apps, fighting lag and limitations every day. But even then, I couldn't stop. Curiosity kept pushing me forward.",
      "freelance": "Later, my father — working abroad and fighting his own battles — sent me money for a new laptop. With that, another chapter began. I took small freelance jobs, built simple posts, designed local graphics. Every small task felt like a step forward.",
      "viral": "Then one day, I created a Facebook frame for a local campaign. It went viral — over two million people used it. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My small creation had reached a world I had never seen.",
      "agency": "After working small freelance jobs and gaining momentum, I eventually joined a local marketing agency. It became my real training ground — a place where I learned branding, social content, client communication, and the early foundation of creative strategy. For the first time, I felt like my skills were becoming something real, something useful.",
      "agencyStruggle": "But life isn't a straight line. The agency started to struggle. Budgets dropped, clients left, and slowly, the work dried up. Eventually, the agency had to shut down completely. I suddenly found myself without a job — and with a family depending on me.",
      "restaurant": "Out of responsibility, not ambition, I decided to start a restaurant business. It wasn't my dream, but it was a way to support my family, to survive, to keep moving. I learned cooking, sourcing, delivery, customer service — everything I had never imagined I'd do. For a while, it worked. Not perfectly, not smoothly, but enough to keep us going.",
      "covid": "And then COVID happened. In a matter of weeks, the restaurant fell apart. Customers disappeared. Expenses didn't. The economy collapsed. And with it, everything I had built collapsed too. Debt grew. Pressure grew. Reality pushed harder than ever.",
      "dubai": "It reached a point where staying wasn't an option anymore. I needed to try again — somewhere bigger, somewhere with opportunity. My family made a painful decision: we sold our last cow to buy my ticket to Dubai. It wasn't dramatic. It was quiet. It was heavy. It was full of hope and heartbreak tangled together. I left home with a small bag, a bigger dream, and the weight of my family's trust on my shoulders."

      "learning": "I learned more in those first months than I had learned in years. I learned because I finally had the tools. I learned because the world finally felt reachable. I learned because curiosity evolved into hunger — the hunger to grow, to understand, to build, to become.",
      "routine": "My routine was simple and brutal: Full-time job by day. Freelancing by night. Learning everywhere in between.",
      "growth": "Days turned into weeks. Weeks into months. Months into years. All filled with learning — not for certificates, not for approval, but for the joy of understanding.",
      "change": "Dubai didn't hand me success. But it gave me the environment where curiosity could breathe freely for the first time. And that changed everything.",
      "today": "I began shaping brands, designing systems, building websites, improving marketing strategies, editing videos, solving creative problems — and discovering that creativity is limitless when you nurture it with intention. I'm still learning. Still improving. Still growing into the person I once hoped I could be. I don't have all the answers. But I have enough curiosity to keep searching."
